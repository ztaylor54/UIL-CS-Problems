Two consecutive odd numbers that are both prime numbers are called twin primes. For example, 5 and 7 are the largest pair of twin primes both less than 10. Likewise, 17 and 19 are the largest pair of twin primes less than 20. Given an input integer `N`, find the largest pair of twin primes less than `N`.  
  
##Input
A data file with several values of `N`, arranged vertically, `5 < N < 10,000`
##Output
The largest pair of twin primes less than `N`, formatted as shown below.
##Sample input:
```
10
20
372
```
##Sample output:
```
5 7
17 19
347 349
```
